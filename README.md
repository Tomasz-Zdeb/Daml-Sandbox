# Daml Sandbox

An overview guide on [Daml](https://www.digitalasset.com/developers) language.

## Getting started

[Daml docs](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/installation.html#) provide a great **Getting Started** guide. This project will be based on **Daml Open Source**.

> Please take into account that projects generated by **Daml** toolkit may be provided under different licensing terms than this guide.

```powershell
daml version
```

Displays versions of installed SKDs.

```powershell
daml new <project_name>
```

Creates new project with a specified name and default template. To specify the template use:

```powershell
daml new <project_name> --template <template_name>
```

```powershell
daml new --list
```

Lists all the available project templates

## Templates

They are the most important component of **Daml** ecosystem. They define **data** and **behavior** of **Contracts** on **Daml Ledger**. Which means they provide logic that answers these questions:

* Who can see what?
* Who can alter the ledger?
* How can they alter the ledger?
* Under what conditions?

### `With` section

**Template** declaration must start with: `with` section. Data fields are defined in the `with` section.

> The requirement the `with` section is to contain at least one `Party`.  

```haskell
template MyOffer
  with
    issuer: Party
    owner: Party
    price: Decimal
    royaltyRate: Deciaml
    (...)
```

> In general `with` section a mix of **Parties** included in the contract as well as the contract's **payload**.

### `where` section

The `where` section contains:

* `signatory` - list of **Parties** that are being stated as **signatories** of the **contract**. A **signatory** is a participant in a contract which consented to the creation of that template.

  >The requirement is to have at least one **Party** stated as the signatory

* `observer` (optional) - including **Parties** as **observers** allows to make these **Parties** aware of the contract. Whereas if some **Party** is specified in the `controller` block, the **Party** will be aware of the contract anyway, so the `observer` block should be used for granting the right to see the contract to additional **Parties**.

* `ensure` (optional) - boolean expression, that has to be `true` for the contract creation. E.g.  

```haskell
ensure royaltyRate >= 0.0 && lastPrice >= 0.0
```

* `key`
